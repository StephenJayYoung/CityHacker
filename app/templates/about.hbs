      <h2 class="hey">About Us</h2>
        CityHacker is a website that grew out of the blog of Stephen Jay Young. Steve traversed the US looking for his perfect city. Along the way, he found life would have been a whole lot more awesome if there were only a website where he could connect with other people who liked the same things that he liked. For awhile he tried forcing himself to go to meet ups all the time, and that worked ok, but it was all about work and networking. Steve wanted friends to run with, drink with, play music with, etc. When Steve started the JavaScript Immersion course at Portland Code School in Fall 2014, he met Kali Kiger, who had also recently relocated to Portland, and Andrea Moulding, who had been here about 2 years. All 3 agreed that despite their very different interests, all 3 would use a site like CityHacker! Agreeing on this need, they decided to build the CityHacker website for their capstone project. Arise CityHacker, the site where you can make friends who will help you hack any city.
