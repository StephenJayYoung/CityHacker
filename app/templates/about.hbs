        CityHacker is a web app that grew out of the blog of Stephen Jay Young. Steve traversed the U.S. looking for the perfect city to live in, and quickly realized that the best way to get to know a place and its people was through activities. For a while, he tried to force himself to go to MeetUps, but quickly realized that it was very challenging to forge authentic friendships in this manner. Steve wanted friends to run with, drink with, play music with, etc. When Steve started the JavaScript Immersion course at Portland Code School in Fall 2014, he met Kali Kiger, who had also recently relocated to Portland, and Andrea Moulding, who had been there about 2 years. All 3 agreed that despite their very different interests, they could use an app like CityHacker! Agreeing on this need, they decided to build the CityHacker application for their capstone project. Arise CityHacker, the app where you can make friends who will help you hack any city.
