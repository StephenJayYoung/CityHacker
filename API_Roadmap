##gmapAPI

#PLAN:

1. Use google maps to get the api address. Then use that address to get a longitude and a latitude.

#Steps
1. Figure out which google api to use (Gelocation api?)
1. Create a route
1. Plug in the api using ajax and ember syntax
1. Console log and pull up the appropriate path in order to obtain the long and lat
1. Return the path, access it through the handlebars api
1. Test the API to make sure that it is functioning properly. Set up a fake server in order to do this.
