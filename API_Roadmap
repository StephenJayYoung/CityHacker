##gmapAPI Roadmap

#PLAN:
1. Show the users current location so that users can be matched based on location. Create a button that enables the user to manipulate their desired location.
1. From the users perspective: the current location will automatically be entered into the app via the browser method. The user will be able to manipulate this by entering a desired location in their profile.


##Steps
1. Use the browser method to access the user's current location. This will create an object
1. Use a callback, and plug this into the gmap api in order to return the name of that location.

1. Figure out which google api to use (Gelocation api?)
1. Create a route
1. Plug in the api using ajax and ember syntax
1. Console log and pull up the appropriate path in order to obtain the long and lat
1. Return the path, access it through the handlebars api
1. Test the API to make sure that it is functioning properly. Set up a fake server in order to do this.
